# 🛡️ Downtime Guard

**Downtime Guard** is a minimalist Android app I’m building to help reduce time spent on distracting apps. It’s a passion project designed around mindfulness, not restriction—made for people like me who want to use tech more intentionally.

I’m sharing this project publicly to showcase the concept and my development journey. Feel free to explore and follow along—but please note this isn’t open for reuse or contributions at this time.

## 📱 What It Does

- Tracks screen time using Android’s Usage Stats API
- Lets you flag certain apps as "distractions"
- (Coming soon) Visual breakdowns (pie/line charts)
- (Planned) Gentle reminders when you pass a usage threshold

This isn’t about blocking apps—it’s about **awareness** and **self-accountability**.

## 🧠 Why I Made This

I found myself often getting stuck in doomscroll loops and wanted a simple, low-friction way to:

- Reflect on where my time goes
- Catch myself before I drift too long
- Learn Android development through a practical tool

Instead of relying on heavy app blockers, this app takes a *self-driven* approach to digital wellness.
